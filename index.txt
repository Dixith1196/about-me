Deekshith Maram - Section 03 - Dr. Eloe / 10am

Hello, I'm Deekshith Maram from India. I am in my first semester of Masters in Applied Computer Science.  

I've had good Industrial experience in developing Mobile apps using an iOS framework and in cross-platform such as React-Native and also had few months of experience in front-end development using ReactJS. I worked for a couple of years in Magure Softwares located in Hyderabad, India. I've also done some research in developing applications using trending technologies like augmented reality using iOS Arkit. 

In the future, I would like to work for a product development company that is very advanced in technology like Apple. Later I would like to work on some proof of concepts that I have in my mind using trending technologies to build my own product development startup. 

I'm attaching my LinkedIn profile URL, I would really love some connections to build -
